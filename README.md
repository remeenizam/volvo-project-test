# volvo-project-test
In this project. I have created 3 suites and run the test.
Volvocars has saved more than a million lives with its three-point seat belt and we are on a mission
now to save a million more lives, starting with this campaign. You are the test lead for the campaign
team and you need to setup a set of automated test suite using webdriverio (we believe test stack
should be close to tech stack).
Things we would like to see in the code:
1. Setup the solution with its Dockerized image.
2. Parallel execution of tests
3. Reporting of the results
4. Documentation
